    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I am Bikash Kumar Malik, currently 28 years old. My origins trace back to Odisha, but I have been a lifelong resident of Haldia, West Bengal. I completed my schooling in this vibrant community and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Electronics from the Haldia Institute of Technology in 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since entering the corporate world, I have amassed over five years of experience in customer relationship management and customer service. This journey has equipped me with invaluable skills and extensive knowledge through collaborations with various clients and customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like a small seed striving to reach new heights, I am committed to personal and professional growth, continually seeking to expand my horizons. I firmly believe that challenges are merely opportunities in disguise, and I embrace each challenge as a chance to learn and evolve.
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion for technology drives my curiosity to explore and understand the latest innovations. I enjoy engaging in discussions about tech advancements and how they can improve lives. One of my favorite pastimes is watching Formula One, which I regard as the pinnacle of motorsport excellence, embodying precision, speed, and relentless pursuit of improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
            I aspire to inspire others by sharing knowledge and experiences, fostering a collaborative environment where ideas can flourish. My goal is to make a positive impact, whether in the workplace or the community, as I believe that together, we can achieve greatness. 
        </p>
        <p>
            That encompasses my journey thus far, and I sincerely hope to connect with you to learn more about your experiences as well.
